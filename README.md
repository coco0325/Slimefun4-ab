# Slimefun 4
Slimefun is a plugin which aims to basically turn your Bukkit Server into a modpack like FTB without installing a single mod. It offers everything you could possibly imagine. From Backpacks to Jetpacks...
It also adds an API allowing you guys to easily install/code Addons for this.
You own a Server which is not only minigame-based and your Players got bored of playing Survival?
Then you will absolutely love this Plugin! 
It adds a whole new Layer of Survival to your Server by adding more than 400+ new Items!
